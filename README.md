# Competitive Programming Toolset

This repo aims to collect useful implementations of common algorithms in the
Competitive Programming domain. This algorithms are collected as a library
so that they can be easily used during a contest.

*NOTE*: this algorithms should only be used in Competitive Programming, do not 
use them in production as they be full of bad coding practices.

## Useful Resources

- [UVa Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php): Online automated judge 
for programming problems, its problem archive has over 4300 problems.
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/): Website that provides challenges
for several different domains such as Algorithms, Mathematics, SQL, 
Functional Programming, AI, and more. HackerRank also provides the ability for 
users to submit applications and apply to jobs by solving company-sponsored 
coding challenges.
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/): One of the most active websites that 
hosts Competitive Programming contests. After the contests problem editorials
are published by problem authors, it is a good way of getting started in 
Competitive Programming.
